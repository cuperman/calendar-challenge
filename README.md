# Calendar Challenge

Make the calendar display the current month dynamically, and augment the links to navigate to other months.

## Requirements

- The markup should match the structure mocked in index.html
- Display the current month on initialization
- When 'next' link is clicked, display next month
- When 'last' link is clicked, display last month
- When 'this' link is clicked, display this month

## Details

You can include other libraries or frameworks, but the purpose is to create your own date, time, and calendar logic. Feel free to create additional files if necessary.

## Bonus

Use es2015
